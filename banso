my lord he died for a kingdom
to redeem the hearts of men
now my people don't you weep 
he has risen from his sleep
he lives again
alleluia.
my lord renewed all creation
that had waited late and long
now the season and the sea
live and love the risen Lord
this is our song
my lord came forth like the morning
with the splendor of the sun
came triumphant fron the tomb from the darkness
of the tomb
the victory won
alleluia
